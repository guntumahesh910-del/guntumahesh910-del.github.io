    <h1>Programming Languages: Basics and Advanced</h1>
    <p>This website provides high-level overviews of popular programming languages, including basic and advanced definitions.</p>

    <div class="language">
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <div class="basic">
            <strong>Basic Definition:</strong> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, and scripting.
        </div>
        <div class="advanced">
            <strong>Advanced Definition:</strong> Python supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming paradigms. It features dynamic typing, automatic memory management via garbage collection, and extensive libraries like NumPy for scientific computing and Django for web frameworks. Its GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) can limit multi-threading performance in CPU-bound tasks.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="language">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <div class="basic">
            <strong>Basic Definition:</strong> JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for web development to add interactivity to websites. It runs in the browser and is essential for front-end development.
        </div>
        <div class="advanced">
            <strong>Advanced Definition:</strong> JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm language with event-driven, asynchronous capabilities via promises and async/await. It supports closures, higher-order functions, and has evolved with ES6+ features like arrow functions and modules. Node.js extends it to server-side development, enabling full-stack JavaScript applications.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="language">
        <h2>Java</h2>
        <div class="basic">
            <strong>Basic Definition:</strong> Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's used for building enterprise applications and Android apps.
        </div>
        <div class="advanced">
            <strong>Advanced Definition:</strong> Java enforces strong typing and supports generics, annotations, and reflection. It uses bytecode compilation for portability, with features like automatic garbage collection and concurrency via threads and the java.util.concurrent package. Frameworks like Spring enable dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="language">
        <h2>C++</h2>
        <div class="basic">
            <strong>Basic Definition:</strong> C++ is a general-purpose programming language that extends C with object-oriented features. It's used for system programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.
        </div>
        <div class="advanced">
            <strong>Advanced Definition:</strong> C++ supports multiple inheritance, operator overloading, and templates for generic programming. It offers low-level memory management with pointers and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for exception safety. Modern C++ (C++11 and later) includes smart pointers, lambdas, and move semantics for efficiency in high-performance computing.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="language">
        <h2>Ruby</h2>
        <div class="basic">
            <strong>Basic Definition:</strong> Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented scripting language focused on simplicity and productivity. It's popular for web development with the Ruby on Rails framework.
        </div>
        <div class="advanced">
            <strong>Advanced Definition:</strong> Ruby emphasizes duck typing and metaprogramming, allowing runtime code modification. It supports blocks, procs, and lambdas for functional programming. Ruby on Rails uses conventions over configuration, with Active Record for ORM and RESTful routing, enabling rapid prototyping and scalable web apps.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="language">
        <h2>Go (Golang)</h2>
        <div class="basic">
            <strong>Basic Definition:</strong> Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by Google for efficient, concurrent systems. It's used for cloud services, networking, and DevOps tools.
        </div>
        <div class="advanced">
            <strong>Advanced Definition:</strong> Go features goroutines for lightweight concurrency and channels for communication, inspired by CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes). It has built-in garbage collection, interfaces for polymorphism, and a focus on simplicity with no inheritance. Its standard library includes powerful tools for HTTP servers and JSON handling, making it ideal for microservices.
